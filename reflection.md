# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would i give to myself?
Look back at previous projects and demos to figure out how i could make things neater and more optimized.
Try not using so many ifs.

## Was everthing in needs done?
Not quite. I didn't get a main menu with settings in and the ghosts don't exactly path find to the player.

## What was the hardest part
Getting the maze to generate properly. Couldn't get it to generate up and left and i couldn't stop the maze from breaking when generating more chunks.

## Were there any problems that could not be solved?
Making the death particles randomize to a negative and positive number for some reason. It will always return a 0 to 1 no matter what and i have no clue how that's happening.
Getting the ghost to not phase through walls without bugging out and floating away from the player.
Showing touch controls on a non touch screen device.
The maze breaking when new chunks of the maze generate.
The maze being being unable to properly generate new chunks left and up despite the many attempts i have tried (looks like i haven't bothered trying to add it in sketch.js but trust me i really tried)
The game crashing when going too far up.

## What could i have done better for this project?
Use less ifs, find better ways to optimize the game, changing how the maze generates completely to solve the issues above, figure out different ways of adding some form of support for different devices, and actually try using different files instead of just putting everything in sketch.js.
