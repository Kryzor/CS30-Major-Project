# Project Description

A continuation of my grid based assignment

Building a endless pacman that infinitely generates the a maze

# Major Project Proposal

## Need to have
- Actual infinite generation
- A camera that follows the player
- ghosts that use AI to move to the player
- Pellets and bigger pellets for eating ghosts
- Animated sprites for pacman and ghosts
- Score counter
- Main menu with settings

## Nice to have
- Skins for the player and possibly ghosts
- Dramatic effects for eating ghosts or being killed by ghosts
    - Like a particle explosion and a camera shake when eating a ghost
    - Sort of the same thing for when pacman gets killed
